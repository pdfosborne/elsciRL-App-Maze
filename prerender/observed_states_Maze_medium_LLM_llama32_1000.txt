The legal moves available from this position are numbered actions [1, 2, 4, 7]. A brief history of the states and actions taken so far in this episode shows that we previously navigated to state 0 (1_4) by taking action 2, then reached state 3 (3_3) after taking action 5, and briefly reached state 2 (2_2) before going back to state 1 (1_2) with another action 5. We then progressed from state 1 (1_2) to our current position by taking action 7.", "4_3": "In the current state, you are located at position (4, 3) in the maze. The walls of the maze are close by, with significant proximity to the east and south walls.

The agent has a clear path to move in four possible directions: north (x=5, y=1) by action [0], east (x=6, y=2) by action [1], south (x=4, y=2) is blocked and not reachable, and west (x=4, y=3) by action [3]. The agent can also move left (x=3, y=2) or right (x=7, y=2) by actions [2] and [6], respectively.", "6_2": "The current state is located at position (6, 2), with the maze walls surrounding it. The agent can move in four possible directions: up, right, down, or left. Specifically, the legal moves are to move to positions (0, 2), (6, 4), (0, 6), and (6, 0).

To your right is a wall, and to your left is an open path that leads away from the starting point. In front of you is a path that continues straight. You can move up or down one step along this path. Your options for moving are: you can move east (to position 1_3), west (to position 1_0), or north (to position 2_1). The maze layout suggests that these actions could potentially lead to different locations and proximity to the walls, but the exact outcome is not yet determined.", "1_2": "The current state is a 2D maze with positions (1,2) and proximity to the walls. There are three possible moves available from this position: up (position 0), right (not applicable as it would be out of bounds), or down (position 5). The agent's previous actions have led to the following sequence of states and moves: moving right from position (3,4) and then staying still, then moving left from position (2,4) but not changing the x-position, then moving up from position (1,4) and finally moving down from position (3,3) and right from position (2,2).", "2_2": "The current state is located at position 2, on the second row of a 2x5 maze.

The agent can move in the following directions: up (direction 0), right (direction 1), down is not available as moving left would be out of bounds but direction 3 means moving left then going back to previous x which will place the agent on the second row so effectively moving down is what you would have done if you moved left and gone up from there. Direction 4 means moving right then going back to the first row (position 1,4)  and direction 6 is an invalid action in this state.", "3_4": "In the current state, you are located at position (3,4) in the maze. You have five possible legal moves available to you: moving up (represented by action index 0), down (action index 1), left (action index 2), move through a gap between two walls (action index 5), and move through another wall (action index 7).

You have four possible moves to consider: up, down, left, and right, as indicated by actions 0, 3, 4, and 6, respectively. The agent's history reveals that it has taken these actions before reaching this state: it moved north from position (2,1) to (5,1), then took a move to the right from (3,2) to (4,2), moved down from (4,5) to (4,4), and finally went left from (1,5) to (1,4).", "4_5": "The current state is located at position (4,5) in the maze, with the agent 4 steps to the right and 5 steps forward from the starting point. The agent is also 1 step away from a wall to the left and has close proximity to another wall to the right.

There are four possible moves to consider from this location: moving right by 2 spaces (position 6), up by 1 space (position 5), left by 1 space (position 3), and down by 2 spaces (position 0). The agent has previously taken actions at these positions, resulting in the following outcomes.

The agent has a clear view of the surrounding walls and can see possible moves to the left, right, up, and down. However, it's worth noting that moving up or down is not possible due to being adjacent to the top or bottom walls, respectively. Therefore, the available legal actions are: move one step left (0), move one step right (1), move one position forward in a previously visited cell (4), or move backwards (6).", "5_1": "You are currently at position (5,1) in the maze. There is a wall to your right and one step to the left that you can take without going out of bounds. You are also very close to two walls on adjacent sides but there is still enough space between them that taking another step in either direction would be permissible. Your goal seems to be to navigate towards position (0,5), which appears to be a valid target location given the provided prior states and actions. The legal moves available to you are: moving 1 step left, 3 steps right, or 7 steps forward.", "6_1": "The current state is located at position (6, 1) in the maze. There are walls on three sides of this location. The agent can move left to position (5, 1), down to position (6, 2), or up to position (5, 2).

The legal moves available to the agent are moving up two spaces (to position 7,7), down three spaces (to position 4,7), left four spaces (to position 1,2), or right five spaces (to position 10,6). This information is based on the prior states and actions taken in the current episode, which shows that the agent previously moved up from position (6,1) to (5,2) with an action of moving left, then moved down from position (5,2) to (1,1) with an action of moving right.", "6_4": "The current state is located at position (6, 4) within the maze. There are walls to the north, south, and east of this cell. The agent has just taken action 2, which moved them from position (6, 1) in a northerly direction to their current location. The history shows that since then, the agent took actions 5, 3, 7, moving them west, southwest, and then north again, respectively. Now, the agent can choose to move north (action 2), east (action 1), or south (action 4) in their next step.", "6_6": "The current state is in the maze, located at position (6, 6), with walls on either side. The agent has taken several actions prior to this point. Historically, moving down and right seems to be a common path, as shown by the transitions from positions (5,1) to (3,1) and (5,2) to (3,2). However, it appears that trying to move up or left does not result in progress, suggesting these actions may be blocked by walls. The available legal moves from the current position are moving down (0) or right (2), which seem like viable next steps based on the observed transitions.", "1_6": "You are currently located at position (1, 6) in the maze. To move forward, you can either go up (position 0, 6) or down to position 5 (these moves correspond to actions 0 and 3 respectively).
