Reviewing previous states reveals that navigating through the maze involves back-and-forth movement, with some episodes resulting in minor adjustments to your position. Notably, you moved 3 units to the right from a prior state at 5_9, and later moved up twice from a subsequent state at 3_9, before moving down from 2_9.

The agent has previously navigated through the maze and encountered several states during this episode. Notably, the agent had previously been at position (1, 9) and moved east to position (2, 9). Subsequently, the agent moved south from position (2, 9) to reach a new state at position (1, 10), but then moved north again to return to (1, 9).
