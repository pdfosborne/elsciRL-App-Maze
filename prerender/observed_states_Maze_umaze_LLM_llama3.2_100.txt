{"1_3": "In the current maze state, your position is at coordinates (1, 3), with walls on three sides. You can move either up two spaces to reach coordinate (1, 5) or down three spaces to reach coordinate (-1, 3). The previous states and actions taken in this episode are as follows: from a similar starting state, you moved right two spaces to reach coordinate (1, 2), then up three spaces to reach coordinate (1, 1), then left one space to reach coordinate (1, 0), but instead of moving down, you moved right six spaces to an invalid position. Before that, you were at the goal coordinates (3, 1) and moved left one space to reach this state.", "1_2": "In the current maze environment, you are positioned at coordinates (1, 2). You have a view of your surroundings, including the walls that surround the maze. Your options for movement are limited to moving up, right, down, or left to positions within the maze boundaries, as indicated by the legal moves: [0, 1, 5, 7]. Note that these move indices correspond to specific coordinates within the maze grid. Specifically, a move of 0 would take you up from your current position, while a move of 1 would move you right. The history provided earlier will help inform your decision-making as we proceed with this episode.", "2_1": "You are currently located at position (2, 1) in the maze, with the wall to your left and the wall to your right. The wall directly ahead of you is at a distance of 1 unit. You can move up 2 units, right 3 units, or left 6 units from your current position. This information is based on previous actions taken in this episode, where you were previously located at (1, 2) and moved down to reach the current state (2, 1), and before that, you were at (1, 1).", "1_1": "We are currently at position (1,1) in the maze. This position is adjacent to two walls, which means we have limited options for movement. Our available actions are moving east or west, represented by the numbers 1 and 3 on the coordinate axes. To put this into perspective, if we move east from our current position (1,1), we would be in position (1,2). The previous state before taking action 0 was at position (1,2) but no action was taken in that step, so it doesn't affect our current understanding of the environment.", "3_1": "You are currently at position (3, 1) in the maze. The walls surrounding you are to your left and right. To move forward, you have two options: move up or down, as moving left or right would put you closer to the wall. Your previous actions have led you from a state of (1, 2), then to (1, 1) after taking no action, and finally to the current state at (3, 1) after taking the actions 0 and 3, and then 3 again respectively, which likely took you up to your current position.", "2_3": "You are currently at position (2, 3) in the maze. To your left is a wall, and to your right is another wall, with a gap allowing movement in that direction. The walls appear to be perpendicular to each other, creating a four-way intersection. You can move either up or down to exit the current room, as moving left or right would result in a dead end. Your options are to move up to position (2, 4) or down to position (2, 2), with no immediate obstacles in the way of these moves.", "3_3": "You are currently at position (3,3) in the maze, with walls on all sides. Your prior actions and outcomes have led you to this point. Specifically, from a previous position of (1,1), moving right resulted in being at (2,1), then moving down brought you to (3,1). From there, moving left put you back to your current position of (3,3), and the last action taken was moving up to bring you here. The only possible moves available from this position are to move down or move right, as moving up would take you outside the maze's boundaries, and moving left or down would go against the path that led you here."}
